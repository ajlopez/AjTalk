## Origin

Migrated from my SVN project: http://code.google.com/p/ajtalk/

## Interpreter

TBD

## Compiler

The compiler transform Smalltalk source code to bytecodes, and run the bytecodes. Or it compiles to JavaScript code, to be run
by [AjTalkJs](https://github.com/ajlopez/AjTalkJs).

The idea is to traverse the internal AST to compile to different languages. Next target: Python?
